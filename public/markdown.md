# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to format plain text documents.  
Write docs for your GitHub projects, edit your GitHub profile _README_ etc. You fill find it all here.

## Paragraph

By writing regular text you are basically writing a paragraph.

```
This is a paragraph.
```

This is a paragraph.

## Headings

There are 6 heading variants. The number of "#" symbols, followed by text, indicates the importance of the heading.

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Emphasis

Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.

```
Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.
Two underscores __work as well__.
Let's make it *italic now*.
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?
```

## Blockquote

Want to emphasise importance of the text? Say no more.

```
> This is a blockquote.
> Want to write on a new line with space between?
>
> > And nested? No problem at all.
> >
> > > PS. you can **style** your text _as you want_.
```

## Images

The best way is to simply drag & drop image from your computer directly. You can also create reference to image and assign it that way.  
Here is the syntax.

```
![text if the image fails to load](auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Text displayed on hover")

[logo]: auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Hover me"
![error text][logo]
```

![text if the image fails to load](https://openstandia.jp/oss_info/image/ossinfo_icon_nextjs.png 'Text displayed on hover')

## Links

Similar to images, links can also be inserted directly or by creating a reference. You can create both inline and block links.

## Code

You can cerate both inline and full block code snippets. You can also define programming language you were using in your snippet. All by using backticks.

````
    I created `.env` file at the root.
    Backticks inside backticks? `` `No problem.` ``

    ```
    {
      learning: "Markdown",
      showing: "block code snippet"
    }
    ```

    ```js
    const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
    console.log(x);
    ```
````

```
{
  learning: "Markdown",

}
```

```js
const x = 'Block code snippet in JS'
console.log(x)
```

## Lists

As you can do in HTML, Markdown allows creating of both ordered and unordered lists.

### Ordered List

```
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React
7. I'm Frontend Dev now üë®üèº‚Äçüé®
```

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React
5. I'm Frontend Dev now üë®üèº‚Äçüé®

### Unordered List

```
- Node.js
+ Express
* Nest.js
- Learning Backend ‚åõÔ∏è
```

- Node.js

* Express

- Nest.js

* Learning Backend ‚åõÔ∏è

### Mixed List

You can also mix both of the lists and create sublists.  
**PS.** Try not to create lists deeper than two levels. It is the best practice.

```
1. Learn Basics
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   7. Javascript
2. Learn One Framework
   - React
     - Router
     - Redux
   * Vue
   + Svelte
```

## Table

Great way to display well-arranged data. Use "|" symbol to separate columns and ":" symbol to align row content.

```
| Left Align (default) | Center Align | Right Align |
| :------------------- | :----------: | ----------: |
| React.js             | Node.js      | MySQL       |
| Next.js              | Express      | MongoDB     |
| Vue.js               | Nest.js      | Redis       |
```

## Horizontal Line

You can use asterisks, hyphens or underlines (-, \*, \_) to create horizontal line.
The only rule is that you must include at least three chars of the symbol.

```

First Horizontal Line

---

Second One

***

Third

___

```
